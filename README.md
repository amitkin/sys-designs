This repository contains a some object oriented programming designs solutions for a few famous design problems implemented mostly for kicks and learning. Hopefully might help someone in need! _**Feel free to fork, copy, suggest corrections or ask questions. Happy designing :)**_

## [Contents](https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/oop-designs)
Given below is a list of design problems implemented in this repository.

### [1. Movie Theater Seating](https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/oop-designs/tree/master/movie-theater)
Movie Theater Seating project allocates seats in a movie theater to incoming requests in an efficient way which maximizes theater profit as well as gives closely located seats made in a single request. To efficiently allocate seats for maximizing profit for the movie theater, as well as to give customers closely located seats, we use a clustered seat allocation algorithm. In the current support it is capable of taking seat reservation request input from a file and writes the seat reservation details to an output file. However the design is flexible to take inputs and dispatch outputs to any source with code extension.

### [2. Lift](https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/oop-designs/tree/master/lift)
Lift project is an implementation of a lift operating system that fullfils end users request by assigning a lift from a lift pool. For an efficient lift scheduling, we use in minimum in-path distance lift allocation algorithm that tries to minimze the distance of a lift car from the request origination floor. In the current support it is capable of taking lift floor call requests input from a file and writing the lift allocation details to an output file. However the design is flexible to take inputs and dispatch outputs to any source with code extension.

### [3. System Design Approach](https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/oop-designs/tree/master/sda)
System design approach explains a basic appproach that should be followed while solving any architectural or system level design questions. Questions like design  Monitoring or Search & Recommendation Systems and products like AWS, Netflix, Uber etc. fall into these categories. The aim here is to create an efficient yet generic enough approach that can be applied to a variety of architectural & high level design problems.
