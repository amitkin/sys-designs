This repository contains a some object oriented programming designs solutions for a few famous design problems implemented mostly for kicks and learning. Hopefully might help someone in need! _**Feel free to fork, copy, suggest corrections or ask questions. Happy designing :)**_

## [Contents] (https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/oop-designs)
Given below are a list of design problems implemented in this repository.

### [1. Movie Theater Seating] (https://github.com/shivam-maharshi/oop-designs/tree/master/movie-theater)
Movie Theater Seating project solves allocates seats in a movie theater to incoming requests in an efficient way which maximizes theater profit as well as gives closely located seats made in a single request. In the current support it is capable of taking seat reservation request input from a file and writes the seat reservation details to an output file. However the design is flexible to take inputs and dispatch outputs to any source with code extension.
